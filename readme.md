# CNB Money

This package is used in the same way as `moneyphp/money` is used, 
with additional method 
`Zrnik\Money\Money::convertTo(Currency $currency)`.

Also `Zrnik\Money\Money::toString()` returns a properly formatted currency string.

Temp directory to save czech national bank 
data san be set with `Zrnik\Money\Money::$tempDir` 
variable (in your bootstrap script).
